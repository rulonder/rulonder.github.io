Prepare your cardboard, during the last month I had some spare time and I missed fiddling around with GLSL shaders so I went ahead and prepare an orbit visualizer in VR.

you can access it from the following link 

[Try me](https://spacevr-ba328.firebaseapp.com/)

First you select one of the orbits available and then the kind of visualizer you want to use i.e. regular 3d or a cardboard friendly representation.

I will prepare some more posts in order to detail the shaders and the main configuration of this webapp.
