# Create a static blog based on markdown and gulp

This is my first attemp at creating a blog, and I had some wished in the way to handle it:

- Use static content : I plan to deploy it as a github page 
- Use markdown to generate the entries: I feel confortable editing markdown.
- Automate the creation of the entries list, based on a configurable template

The easy solution , and probably the best way to go would have been to use jekyll as it is a very complete framework for this porpouse. Nevertheless, I wanted to take look a gulp , and learn about it so I decided to build it using it.
